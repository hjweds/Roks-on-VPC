This module provisions instances of Cloud Object Storage, Key Protect, LogDNA and Sysdig. Your images in your OpenShift cluster internal registry are automatically backed up to an IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket. Key Protect is used for encryption of worker nodes. LogDNA and Sysdig are used for logging and monitoring of the cluster.
